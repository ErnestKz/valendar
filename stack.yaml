# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
# resolver: lts-3.5
# resolver: nightly-2015-09-21
# resolver: ghc-7.10.2
#
# The location of a snapshot can be provided as a file or url. Stack assumes
# a snapshot provided as a file might change, whereas a url resource does not.
#
# resolver: ./custom-snapshot.yaml
# resolver: https://example.com/snapshots/2018-01-01.yaml
# resolver:
#   url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/lts/17/9.yaml
resolver: lts-17.9
# User packages to be built.
# Various formats can be used as shown in the example below.
#
# packages:
# - some-directory
# - https://example.com/foo/bar/baz-0.0.2.tar.gz
#   subdirs:
#   - auto-update
#   - wai
packages:
- .
# Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver.
# These entries can reference officially published versions as well as
# forks / in-progress versions pinned to a git hash. For example:
#
extra-deps:
- acme-missiles-0.3 # not in the LTS
- gogol-0.5.0
- gogol-core-0.5.0
- gogol-apps-calendar-0.5.0
- servant-0.16.2
- QuickCheck-2.13.2
- aeson-1.4.7.1
# - base-4.13.0.0
- Cabal-3.4.0.0
- array-0.5.4.0
- binary-0.8.8.0
- bytestring-0.10.12.1
- containers-0.6.4.1
- deepseq-1.4.5.0
- directory-1.3.6.1
- filepath-1.4.2.1
- ghc-prim-0.5.3
- mtl-2.2.2
- parsec-3.1.14.0

- stm-2.5.0.0
- text-1.2.4.1
